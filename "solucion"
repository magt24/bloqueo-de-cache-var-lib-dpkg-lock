#These are lock files, which are created to prevent two instances of apt or dpkg from using the same files at the same time. This can happen if an installation is interrupted or did not complete. Remove the lock files at your own risk.
#Manera no recomendada:
yes | sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo rm -fr /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo rm -fr /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm -fr /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo dpkg --configure -a
